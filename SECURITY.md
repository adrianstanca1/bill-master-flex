# Security Architecture Documentation

## Overview
AS Agents implements a comprehensive security framework with multiple layers of protection for construction industry data.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Supabase Auth with OAuth providers (Google)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level isolation by company
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin, Manager, User roles with granular permissions
- **Session Security**: Enhanced session validation with geographic anomaly detection

### Data Protection
- **Company Isolation**: Strict RLS policies ensure users only access their company's data
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data stored using AES encryption
- **Secure Data Store**: Client-side secure storage with encryption
- **Input Validation**: DOMPurify sanitization and comprehensive validation rules

### Threat Detection
- **Brute Force Protection**: Rate limiting with progressive lockouts
- **Geographic Anomaly Detection**: Monitors login locations for suspicious activity
- **Security Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security events
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automated threat detection and alerting

### Security Monitoring
- **Security Events Table**: Centralized logging of all security activities
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit logs for financial operations
- **Security Alerts**: Real-time notifications for security events
- **Health Monitoring**: System health checks and security validation

## Critical Security Configuration

### Supabase Authentication Settings
1. **Navigate to**: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. **Enable**: "Leaked Password Protection" (CRITICAL - currently disabled)
3. **Configure**: Site URL and Redirect URLs for proper OAuth flow

### Environment Security
- All secrets properly managed through Supabase secrets
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- Secure webhook signature validation

## Security Incident Response

### Detection
1. Security events are logged to `security_events` table
2. Real-time monitoring detects suspicious patterns
3. Automated alerts for high-severity events

### Response
1. Immediate lockout for brute force attempts (15 minutes)
2. Geographic anomaly notifications to users
3. Admin notifications for security violations
4. Audit trail preservation for investigation

### Recovery
1. Session refresh for security violations
2. Forced re-authentication for high-risk events
3. Password reset for compromised accounts

## Regular Security Tasks

### Daily
- Monitor security audit logs
- Review failed authentication attempts
- Check for geographic anomalies

### Weekly
- Review user roles and permissions
- Analyze security event patterns
- Test backup and recovery procedures

### Monthly
- Review and update security policies
- Conduct security training
- Update security documentation

### Quarterly
- Full security audit
- Penetration testing
- RLS policy review
- Security architecture assessment

## Security Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance through data minimization
- Right to erasure implemented
- Data portability supported
- Privacy by design principles

### Industry Standards
- OWASP security guidelines followed
- Secure coding practices enforced
- Regular security updates applied
- Vulnerability assessments conducted

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Breach
1. Immediately disable affected accounts
2. Rotate all authentication tokens
3. Notify all users of the breach
4. Conduct forensic analysis
5. Implement additional security measures
6. Report to relevant authorities if required

### System Compromise
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence for investigation
3. Restore from secure backups
4. Implement enhanced monitoring
5. Review and update security policies
